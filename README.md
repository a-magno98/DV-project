# DV-project
Final project for the course Data Visualization.

## Goal 
The goal of the project is to show how it is possible to lie with data regarding COVID-19 vaccination and to show how COVID-19 pandemic vaccines ultimately worked in preventing severe cases of the disease leading to death.

The start of the global COVID-19 pandemic, and its monitoring on a global scale have created lots of data to be dealt with. What is particularly interesting is that for the first time the general public not only was interested in said data, but also had an easy and mainsteam way to access it.

However this accessibility did not translate correctly to a better understanding of the situation. While this is in part due to how the media portrayed the status of the pandemic by highlighting, every day, the random fluctuations in the number of cases as something that is actually relevant, instead of focusing on the actual trend, part of this misinformation comes form the data itself.
Even when using data from reliable sources it is easy to misinterpret it, either by mistake or maliciously.
